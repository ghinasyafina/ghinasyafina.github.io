          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            LatihID is an online nonprofit learning platform that aims to
            improve the skills and competences of small and medium enterprises
            (SMEs) throughout Indonesia by providing high-quality and low-cost
            training modules.
          </p>
          <p>
            In January 2021, LatihID offers an internship program for
            undergraduate students. In this opportunity, I was applying for the
            UI/UX Designer Intern position. During my application, I was tasked
            to evaluate and analyze their current homepage, then make a high
            fidelity prototype from what I have been evaluated.
          </p>
          <h2>Identify and Analyze the Pain Points</h2>
          <p>
            For the first step, I did a heuristic analysis to evaluate the
            performance of the homepage regarding to its interface. I also invited my partner, Rafli, to gain other user perspectives. Here are some
			things we have been discovered:
			<ul>
				<li>Inconsistencies in some buttons, content, and language used</li>
				<li>Asymmetrical card size</li>
				<li>The visibility of some content needs to be improved (contrast, theme used, and size)</li>
			</ul>
		  </p>

      <h2>Design Solutions</h2>
		  <p> 
      Regarding to the pain points that previously mentioned, I try to solve the problem here. I used Figma to help me built the improved homepage of LatihID. I wanted to develop something that is still close to the startup's identity, so I took colors mainly from LatihID's logo and combine it with the colors they have been used in their original homepage.
		  </p>
		  <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
		  <p>
			Finally, I finished the task. Here is what I have improved.
